# What's this?
This is the original version of the wayyy improved fork known as Spotlight-Images.
This one exists as a backup one in case the fork gets destroyed. If it does, I will continue the app going.
For now I am just nothing in this project. This serves as a download to the extremely old first version of the script.
To configure stuff you WILL have to tinker with code.
# Features
- (obviously) collects your Windows Spotlight images. Works on W10 and W11. Use this if you don't want that stinky icon on your desktop.
- Easy to use
- You can choose to open the folder with the images.
# Notes
If you're running Windows 10 it may have bloatware icons in your pngs. That's absolutely fine and the script works. It's Windows 10's fault, not mine.
Windows 11 may have this too but I'm unsure. The bloatware icons thing is absolutely inavoidable and it's part of Windows 10 and maybe 11.
Spotlight never sets a specific image name like "image-1" (they're jpgs, you gotta rename it to jpgs yourself tho as they are just files by default) so its impossible to avoid this issue. If it was the script would be way shorter than it is.
