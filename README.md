# What's this?
A fork of Windows-Spotlight-image-collection that fixes some minor issues and tries to make the script easier to use.
# Features
- (obviously) collects your Windows Spotlight images. Works on W10 and W11. Use this if you don't want that stinky icon on your desktop.
- Easy to use
- You can choose to open the folder with the images.
# Notes
If you're running Windows 10 it may have bloatware icons in your pngs. That's absolutely fine and the script works. It's Windows 10's fault, not mine.
Windows 11 may have this too but I'm unsure. The bloatware icons thing is absolutely inavoidable and it's part of Windows 10 and maybe 11.
Spotlight never sets a specific image name like "image-1" (they're jpgs, you gotta rename it to jpgs yourself tho as they are just files by default) so its impossible to avoid this issue. If it was the script would be way shorter than it is.
